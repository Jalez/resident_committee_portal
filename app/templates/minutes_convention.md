# Minutes Naming Convention

To ensure the application processes and orders the minutes correctly, please use the following naming convention for your PDF files in the Google Drive folder:

**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD_DocName.pdf`

**Examples:**
- `2026-01-05_Hallituksen_kokous_1.pdf`
- `2026-02-14_Vuosikokous.pdf`
- `2025-12-20_Pikkujoulut_memo.pdf`

## How it works
The application automatically sorts the files by name in **descending order**. By putting the date first (Year-Month-Day), the newest files will always appear at the top of the list in the application.

## Yearly Archives
If you wish to separate years in the future, the current system simply lists all files. For now, keep all active PDFs in the same folder. Old files naturally "sink" to the bottom.
